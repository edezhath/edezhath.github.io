I'm a particle physicist in the process of becoming a machine learning practitioner. My PhD research was in high energy phenomenology, which is the meeting point of theory and collider physics - I studied new tests at colliders for dark matter and Higgs sector particles. 

Besides physics, math and machine learning, I enjoy shred guitar, boxing and philosophy.
